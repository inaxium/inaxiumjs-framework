## Welcome to InaxiumJS


### Introduction

InaxiumJS is a data-centric application framework.
It is suitable for developing single page applications with Ecmascript and minimal effort.

To achieve this, smart elements are bound to (columns and rows) of a data store.

### Philosophy

We wanted to keep the programming effort for the framework user as low as possible and work with helpers who get their information from a data information tree .


Configuration over coding is the motto.

### Version

The current version is 2.1
